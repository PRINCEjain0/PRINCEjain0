- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Prince Jain, your friendly neighbourhood coder!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating code thatâ€™s so smooth, it practically glides
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to convince my code to run without errors
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot me an email at pj122333444@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once spent 8 hours debugging, only to realize the issue was that I used a capital letter in "credentials" for 'c' instead of small. Iâ€™m still in therapy.
